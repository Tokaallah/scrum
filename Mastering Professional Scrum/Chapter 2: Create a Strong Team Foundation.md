# Chapter 2: Create a Strong Team Foundation 

Have you ever worked with a group of people who accomplished great things but did not have a strong sense of purpose, did not have healthy debate about different perspectives and ideas, and did not genuinely appreciate each other?

Me neither.


Unfortunately, I’ve also worked with people who had this those things at one point in time but still failed to accomplish great things - or at least didn’t accomplish what felt like our full potential.


We could write an entire book (perhaps an encyclopedia) on the topic of creating a strong team foundation. This chapter attempts to illuminate the most important aspects of developing a team identity and effective teamwork. These aspects require constant care and feeding because who we are as a team, the type of work we are doing, the environment in which we are working, and how we do our work will change over time - often in unplanned and unexpected ways.


## Teams: In a Nutshell


Here is how I summarize the key messages (and add my own flavor):

* Scrum is made of people (bonus points if you get that reference).  
* People are awesome. People are complex. People are weird (including me). Get to know what makes the people around you awesome and weird.
* Teams are at their best when people are able to show up authentically, bringing their full selves to work, leveraging emotional intelligence to learn and grow with each other.
* Teams can navigate the complexities of working together to build amazing things and solve difficult problems when they have a purpose, align around shared values, and know what they want to achieve.
* You cannot motivate people. But you can create an environment that enables intrinsic motivation. Scrum used effectively taps into the three factors for intrinsic motivation.
* Effective self-organization requires shared goals, clear accountabilities, and boundaries. Scrum gives you the minimal pieces to establish these three things.  Where do you need more or less of something?
* Teams are more creative, productive, and resilient when they are collaborating (not merely coordinating their activities). There are five building blocks.  It starts with vulnerability-based trust. This means it can start with you and how you are showing up.
* Teams need enough stability to effectively navigate all of the complex factors summarized above (and many more).


How do you know if your team has enough stability and if they have effectively navigated the complex factors above?

Self-organization, baby!  Ask the team!  


## Outcomes AND Behaviors


As a team seeking to improve, consider both outcomes and behaviors. Yes, we care about outcomes (i.e. high value, usable Increments).  But remember that you cannot control all the variables and guarantee the outcomes. So you have to look at behaviors and intentions as well. Consider the quality of the decision-making that led to the outcomes.

* How much transparency did we have to the aspects of our work and the variables that affected our outcomes?
* How soon did we detect we might be going in the wrong direction and what adaptations did we make?
* How did we demonstrate commitment to the team’s shared goals and quality standards?
* How did we navigate conflict?
* When we get it wrong (and when we get it right), how are we incorporating the insights into who we are as a team and how we work?  How are we learning and growing as a team?

## Insights and Actions

1. Identify a team member with whom you have experienced some personality conflicts. Tell him or her something you appreciate about their personality and how they show up for you and the team.
Keep it simple. You don’t have to explain it. It’s more powerful when you don’t clutter it up with extra words.
2. Where could it be helpful to adapt how you are communicating with your team members based on your strengths and awareness of how you are currently being perceived by others?
3. Review the section 'In Practice: Building Trust.’ Identify one thing you will do (and if relevant, one thing you will stop doing) to grow trust with someone this week.
4. What concept, idea, or statement from this chapter resonated the most for you? (If you’ve taken a class with me, this is what I call your “Aha!" moments.)  Write it down and post it somewhere you can see it everyday.
5. Complete the Call to Action steps at the end of the chapter through team discussion. It doesn’t have to happen in one big meeting. Topics could be discussed over an afternoon walk or coffee break. They could be spread out across the upcoming Sprint. Team members could split into pairs or triads to tackle different questions.
