# Chapter 1: Continuously Improving Your Scrum Practice​

## The Big Why

It is an honor to have Ken Schwaber and Dave West write the Forewords for this book. These are two of the most caring, professional, and wise people I know. If you happened to skip the Forewords, I recommend you take a few minutes to read them. Ken and Dave set the stage for this book, sharing insights on the evolution of Scrum and what it means to apply it with professionalism in our rapidly changing complex world.  


As I write this message to you, I read the Forewords again (for the 38th time). Their words are inspiring. They remind me how much I believe in the work that I do and feel lucky to have found this path.


The insights from Ken and Dave set the stage for the BIG WHY.


We are facing so many challenges in our world. I believe we have the ability to tackle these challenges if we truly tap into what allows people to be their most creative, productive, and fulfilled. I believe in an empirical approach to help us navigate - even when the problems feel impossible, even when we might fail.


And yes, I’m talking beyond software and product development (although technology will likely be a major tool in solving many of our big challenges). So while this book will speak directly to product development, these concepts can be applied in a much wider context.


As you read this book, I encourage you to think about YOUR BIG WHY.  


Perhaps you might also consider how these concepts can be applied beyond your product development team and beyond your organization - wherever you encounter complexity, change, and uncertainty.


## Moving Towards Better Starts with Knowing Where You Are.


Chapter 1 is about the journey. In order to improve, you have to know where you are and begin to establish an idea of where you want to go.


There is no single recipe for success with Scrum. However, there are some ingredients for success - 7 key areas are introduced in this chapter. Your challenge is to think about how these ingredients are combining in your Scrum implementation.  


Where do you need more transparency to help the team adjust their process to handle new challenges?


Has team identity been neglected over time and what impacts is that having?


How are organizational processes slowing down the Scrum Team?


Scrum does not solve your problems.  


People are the ones who have to use Scrum effectively to solve problems and create high value solutions. This requires people to develop the capabilities that the current problems and customer needs demand. This requires an ability to examine how the 7 key areas impact both behaviors and outcomes.


Appendix A is a self-assessment to help you and your team take stock of how well you are using Scrum to enable the benefits of  business agility through effective empiricism and teamwork. (Read this for more on the benefits of business agility.)


## There Are No Best Practices


As you continue in future chapters, you will be presented with concepts, approaches, and practices to help you improve. However, you will still have to do the work to determine what approaches and practices work for you in your context and what capabilities you need to grow to be more effective. Any example practices are just that - examples.   


There are no best practices in Scrum because the work is complex. When a practice or technique is presented in the book, think about the following:

* What type of problem is that practice trying to solve?
* Which of the 7 areas is the technique leveraging?
* What other practices help solve that type of problem?
* How could that practice be even more impactful?
* The point is that it’s more about how you think about your challenges and your approach to solving them. You cannot just copy others. That might work for a period of time, but at some point, it falls apart.  You have to chart your own path towards better.


## Insights and Actions


Write down your BIG WHY.  
It can be a phrase, a paragraph, a metaphor… whatever resonates for you. When things get tough, when you feel like you are failing, come back to YOUR BIG WHY.
* What capabilities do you think are strongest in your team and how do they contribute to your success today?
* What capabilities may need to grow in order to improve in the 7 areas?
* What concept, idea, or statement from this chapter resonated the most for you?  (If you’ve taken a class with me, this is what I call your “Aha!" moments.)  Write it down and post it somewhere you can see it everyday.
* Complete the Call to Action steps at the end of the chapter. (Yes, I know this is a good amount of work. You're worth it. Your team is worth it.)
